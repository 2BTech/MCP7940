# MCP7940 library  -- Work-In-Progress / Unfinished
<img src="https://github.com/SV-Zanshin/MCP7940/blob/master/Images/MCP7940M-PDIP-8.png" width="175" align="right"/> *Arduino* library for accessing the Microchip MCP7940 real time clock.

## Overview
While there is no breakout board available for this chip at the present time, it is not difficult to build into a project. The MCP7940 is available as a PDIP 8 pin which allows for easy use on a breadboard and only a 32.768kHz crystal and 2 small capacitors are required to make the RTC work.
